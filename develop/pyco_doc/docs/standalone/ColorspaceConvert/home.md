## :material-information-outline: About
This utility is targeted at VFX/Animation artists for use in converting input images to a designated target 
color space. It includes export options such as file format, bit depth, and others.

The app only works with 2d images for now. 

!!! bug "Known limitations & bugs"

    * Performance can become very bad with ACES ODTs.
    * Running the app as administrator on Windows will disable drag & drop
    * Converting tiff to png or even using png can cause errors.
    * logging system is actually a joke so doesn't except much from it.

## :material-update: What's next ?

I find the app very basic for now and I suggested some new feature like .tx baking in the past. 
But I run into the dilemna of improving the current application based on a wobbly code or re-writing a fresh new 
application with solid foundations to build bigger things.Unfortunately i'm in 
in a period with not a lot of time which make the choice difficult.

Anyway doesn't except new update for this app, but maybe a new, bigger one in a year :sweat_smile:
