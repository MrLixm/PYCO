## Reg files

Here is a post i made that could help you if you want to manually create/edit a .reg file:

If you want to create your own keys and sub-menus keep in mind that you are limited to 16keys max included the sub-keys
(that's why I have 2 keys for this tool).

If you know how to use python i have published on my github the py file i used to create the reg file in this tool:
