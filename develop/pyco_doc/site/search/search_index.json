Export in a new folder: The file will be placed in a new folder named \"ACEScg\" located at the same location of the original file if no path is given. Else the output files will be placed in the given folder path. Export at the same location: a new file prefixed with the target colorspace or the ODT/Tf will be created. Danger All outputs are cropped to RGBA (if alpha supported) channels. So if you input multi-channel exrs and output exrs, you will lose all your other channels. Compression When choosing the compression amount remember that for jpg 100 means less compression while it is the inverse for exrs. Importing folders When drag&dropping a folder, all the files inside it and its sub-directories will be added! IDT \u00b6 IDTs allow to specify to which colorspace your file primaries belongs too but also which transfer-function is applied. Conversion If the Input colorspace is the same as the Output one, no conversion at all will happens. So it doesn't matter your orignal file primaries, if you just want to switch file format for example you can just use the same colorspace for IDT and Target Cs.

Applying an ACES ODT is the slowest operation. Colorspaces conversion are processed with a Bradford chromatic adaptation.

Import files \u00b6 You can simply drag & drop any supported file(s) or even just a folder. You can also click on the folder icon to open files through your OS explorer. When dragging a folder all the files inside it and its sub-directories will be added! To delete a file you can simply select it and press Del or Backspace . Set the IDT \u00b6 The IDT (Input Device Transform) specifies the input file colorspace primaries, white point and transfer-function. For example Utility-sRGB-Texture specifies that the file has sRGB primaries with the sRGB EOTF transfer function while Utility-sRGB-Linear specifies that the transfer function is Linear To apply an IDT to the desired files: Select one or multiple files in the list (shift+click) Select the desired IDT in the dropdown menu. Click on Apply to Selection / Apply to All (No selection is needed for this one) You can also click & drag down/up to select multiple files quickly in the list. Change Output options \u00b6 Select the colorspace to convert file primaries to in the dropdown. \u00b6 If the IDT and Target Colorspace are the same no conversion will happen. Select your output format: \u00b6 exr The professional-grade image storage format of the motion picture industry to be used in your 3D applications for input such as textures, HDRIs, etc but not for your final displayable-delivery-content. jpg, png Low dynamic range displayable file formats suitable for online-view , previews, thumbnails, etc. A Transfer-function / ODT is required to be applied. Select your bitdepth (output format dependent) \u00b6 Warning When converting HDRIs it is recommended to output a 32bit Float file to not clip any values Pick your compression method (exr only) \u00b6 None: No compression, for archive files mostly. Or if you need maximum reading speed. PIZ: (lossless) Same speed for decompression/compression. Best for scan-line based files. Zip: (lossless) faster decompression and slower compression than PIZ. Best for textures. Zips: (lossless) Same, but can be write/read faster in some software. Dwaa: (lossy) Produce very light files (default compression amount: 45) Dwab: (lossy) Same as above, but can generate faster result in some applications. B44: (lossy) Only for HALF-Float images. Best for real-time playback of image sequence. Read more about this here: https://www.exr-io.com/openexr-data-compression/ . Set the compression amount (output format & compression method dependent) \u00b6 jpg: 100 = Max Quality; 0 = Minimum quality, but light files exr(dwaa/dwaab): 0 means Max quality Select your output location option. \u00b6 Refer to the Functionalities page. Start The Conversion \u00b6 Click on the green \"play\" button in the toolbar to start converting. When a file is converted, it will be removed from the list. If you click on \"Abort\", the currently converted files will still be converted.
