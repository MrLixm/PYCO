You can then extract the zip you got and inside the application folder and open the .exe ACES Workflow Reminder: Reminder that in an ACES workflow, only the color maps need to be converted. This means maps that hold color values displayed in the render image. (a Normal map is not a color map but a scalar/data map). Import files \u00b6 You can simply drag & drop any supported file(s) or even just a folder. You can also click on the folder icon to open files through your OS explorer. When dragging a folder all the files inside it and its sub-directories will be added! To delete a file you can simply select it and press Del or Backspace . Set the IDT \u00b6 The IDT (Input Device Transform) specifies the input file colorspace primaries, white point and transfer-function. For example Utility-sRGB-Texture specifies that the file has sRGB primaries with the sRGB EOTF transfer function while Utility-sRGB-Linear specifies that the transfer function is Linear To apply an IDT to the desired files: Select one or multiple files in the list (shift+click) Select the desired IDT in the dropdown menu. Click on Apply to Selection / Apply to All (No selection is needed for this one) You can also click & drag down/up to select multiple files quickly in the list. Change Output options \u00b6 Select the colorspace to convert file primaries to in the dropdown. \u00b6 If the IDT and Target Colorspace are the same no conversion will happen. Select your output format: \u00b6 exr The professional-grade image storage format of the motion picture industry to be used in your 3D applications for input such as textures, HDRIs, etc but not for your final displayable-delivery-content. jpg, png Low dynamic range displayable file formats suitable for online-view , previews, thumbnails, etc. A Transfer-function / ODT is required to be applied. Select your bitdepth (output format dependent) \u00b6 Warning When converting HDRIs it is recommended to output a 32bit Float file to not clip any values Pick your compression method (exr only) \u00b6 None: No compression, for archive files mostly. Or if you need maximum reading speed. PIZ: (lossless) Same speed for decompression/compression. Best for scan-line based files. Zip: (lossless) faster decompression and slower compression than PIZ. Best for textures. Zips: (lossless) Same, but can be write/read faster in some software. Dwaa: (lossy) Produce very light files (default compression amount: 45) Dwab: (lossy) Same as above, but can generate faster result in some applications. B44: (lossy) Only for HALF-Float images. Best for real-time playback of image sequence. Read more about this here: https://www.exr-io.com/openexr-data-compression/ .

This tool includes a command line interface application, which means no real interface to interact with but lines of commands. Please refer to the startguide for having an explanation of how to use it if you never used CLI(command line interface). Some features \u00b6 Resizing \u00b6 There is two method for resizing exrs, swap-resize and resize. Swap resize was made to perform optimisation on existing textures in a production. It will resize the existing texture, rename the original with a prefix so it can be reversed, and rename the resized version with the same name as the original. Thus, you can quickly resize texture used in your DCC without having to update the path. Resize is the traditionnal resize that will create a new exr resized to the given dimensions. Both method strictly resize to a 1x1 ratio and were designed mainly for textures in mind. Multi-channel to Multi-part \u00b6 When rendering you have the option to include some AOVs in the same exr file. This is usually referred a multi-layer EXR, where a single exr holds multiples images. Where the thing get interesting is that there is actually two types of EXR that can hold multiples \"images\". The multi-channel one consists of creating as much channel as you need for each image, so for example if you display the channels of a multi-channel EXR you will have something like that: ('R', 'G', 'B', 'A', 'Z', 'Diffuse.R', 'Diffuse.G', 'Diffuse.B', 'Emission.R', 'Emission.G', 'Emission.B', 'GIRaw.R', 'GIRaw.G', 'GIRaw.B') At the beginning of the existence of the EXR format this was the only method available, now that the other one exists this method produce EXR that are much slower to read (it depends of the number of channels). The multi-part one is like having multiple images(refered as parts or sub-images) in one single file. When opened, only the desired part is read which product faster read result than the multi-channel method. You can use the Display Info functions to see if your exr is multi-part or multi-channel. Recompress \u00b6 EXR offer different methods of compression divided into lossless or lossy. From the official documentation( https://www.openexr.com/documentation/TechnicalIntroduction.pdf ): Compressing an image with a lossless method preserves the image exactly; the pixel data are not altered. Compressing an image with a lossy method preserves the image only approximately; the compressed image looks like the original, but the data in the pixels may have changed slightly. No matter if it's a multi-part or multi-channel EXR you will be able to change the compression of the whole file with this tool.

Translation : Check if your textures(diffuse reflectance i.e albedo only) are physically correct. This is a command line tool, it means no interface to interact with. Please refer to the startguide for having an explanation of how to use it if you never used CLI(command line interface). The outputted result is an image of the same size as the original with red pixel representing the out-of-gamut ones, and black for the one in the PG. What is the Pointer's Gamut ? The Pointer\u2019s gamut is (an approximation of) the gamut of real surface colors as can be seen by the human eye, based on the research by Michael R. Pointer (1980).

Translation : Check if your textures(diffuse reflectance i.e albedo only) are physically correct. This is a command line tool, it means no interface to interact with. Please refer to the startguide for having an explanation of how to use it if you never used CLI(command line interface). The outputted result is an image of the same size as the original with red pixel representing the out-of-gamut ones, and black for the one in the PG. What is the Pointer's Gamut ? The Pointer\u2019s gamut is (an approximation of) the gamut of real surface colors as can be seen by the human eye, based on the research by Michael R. Pointer (1980).

Tutorial: create a Pointer's Gamut heat map from a multi-layer/part exr \u00b6 Let's say that this time you have a multi-layer exr of one of your render and you would like to analyse the \"albedo\" AOV that it holds: (We skip some steps as they are explained above.) This time instead of createpgmap we are going to use querylayers that will allow us to display all the channels of all the subimages that your exr has. (in case you don't know how your aov is called) Just after the path to the .exe add the path to the render/image \"L:\\apps\\PointerGamutCLTool_v1.exe\" querylayers \"L:\\render\\randomRender.exr\" Hit enter and you will see all the channel for each subimage displayed. Depending on how you exr is made you can get two result. In both case just pick the name of the albedo aov like if you see \"albedoAov.G\", the name is \"albedoAov\". # Example with a render from Redshift (\"multi-layer\" exr) SubImage Index: 0 , Channels: ( 'R' , 'G' , 'B' , 'A' , 'Z' , 'DiffuseFilter.R' , 'DiffuseFilter.G' , 'DiffuseFilter.B' , 'Emission.R' , 'Emission.G' , 'Emission.B' , 'GIRaw.R' , 'GIRaw.G' , 'GIRaw.B' , 'SpecularLighting.R' , 'SpecularLighting.G' ) # Example of the 2nd type of result you can get: (multi-part exr with multiple subimages) SubImage 0 , Channels: ( 'R' , 'G' , 'B' , 'A' ) SubImage 1 , Channels: ( 'depth.Z' , ) SubImage 2 , Channels: ( 'albedo.R' , 'albedo.G' , 'albedo.B' ) SubImage 3 , Channels: ( 'speculard.R' , 'speculard.G' , 'speculard.B' ) SubImage 4 , Channels: ( 'sss.R' , 'sss.G' , 'sss.B' ) So now you can pick the name of the layer you want to analyse (for the Pointer's Gamut we are only interested in the albedo AOV which is called DiffuseFilter by Redshift) Now we can do the same steps as the first part of the tutorial, let's add the createpgmap command , the input_file_path, the output_file_path and the colorspace . \"L:\\apps\\PointerGamutCLTool_v1.exe\" createpgmap \"L:\\render\\randomRender.exr\" \"L:\\render\\renderX_pgmap.jpg\" --colorspace = ACEScg The only difference is this time, add the --layername option with, as value, the name of your albedo aov that we pick before.
