You can then extract the zip you got and inside the application folder and open the .exe ACES Workflow Reminder: Reminder that in an ACES workflow, only the color maps need to be converted. This means maps that hold color values displayed in the render image. (a Normal map is not a color map but a scalar/data map). Import files \u00b6 You can simply drag & drop any supported file(s) or even just a folder. You can also click on the folder icon to open files through your OS explorer. When dragging a folder all the files inside it and its sub-directories will be added! To delete a file you can simply select it and press Del or Backspace . Set the IDT \u00b6 The IDT (Input Device Transform) specifies the input file colorspace primaries, white point and transfer-function. For example Utility-sRGB-Texture specifies that the file has sRGB primaries with the sRGB EOTF transfer function while Utility-sRGB-Linear specifies that the transfer function is Linear To apply an IDT to the desired files: Select one or multiple files in the list (shift+click) Select the desired IDT in the dropdown menu. Click on Apply to Selection / Apply to All (No selection is needed for this one) You can also click & drag down/up to select multiple files quickly in the list. Change Output options \u00b6 Select the colorspace to convert file primaries to in the dropdown. \u00b6 If the IDT and Target Colorspace are the same no conversion will happen. Select your output format: \u00b6 exr The professional-grade image storage format of the motion picture industry to be used in your 3D applications for input such as textures, HDRIs, etc but not for your final displayable-delivery-content. jpg, png Low dynamic range displayable file formats suitable for online-view , previews, thumbnails, etc. A Transfer-function / ODT is required to be applied. Select your bitdepth (output format dependent) \u00b6 Warning When converting HDRIs it is recommended to output a 32bit Float file to not clip any values Pick your compression method (exr only) \u00b6 None: No compression, for archive files mostly. Or if you need maximum reading speed. PIZ: (lossless) Same speed for decompression/compression. Best for scan-line based files. Zip: (lossless) faster decompression and slower compression than PIZ. Best for textures. Zips: (lossless) Same, but can be write/read faster in some software. Dwaa: (lossy) Produce very light files (default compression amount: 45) Dwab: (lossy) Same as above, but can generate faster result in some applications. B44: (lossy) Only for HALF-Float images. Best for real-time playback of image sequence. Read more about this here: https://www.exr-io.com/openexr-data-compression/ . Set the compression amount (output format & compression method dependent) \u00b6 jpg: 100 = Max Quality; 0 = Minimum quality, but light files exr(dwaa/dwaab): 0 means Max quality Select your output location option. \u00b6 Refer to the Features page. Start The Conversion \u00b6 Click on the green \"play\" button in the toolbar to start converting. When a file is converted, it will be removed from the list.
